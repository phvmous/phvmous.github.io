Woo! I am finally done with school, what a long 3 years it was. With that out of the way, I will finally have some time to work on projects and update this blog again. I suppose I will start brushing up on leet code and my web dev stack, since it has been awhile. These last two semesters were about AI Machine learning and Natural Language Processing, which were very interesting topics. The field is constantly changing with new developments coming out almost every other month. And I thought web development moved fast. Nope, not compared to the AI field. Anyways, stay tuned for more updates as I get the ball rolling again.
