Wow, I can't believe it is already February. Time really flies when you're constantly working all the time. I wish I had more time to write more often but it has been really hectic
with CIT592. Out of all the classes I've taken in the program thus far (I've done CIT591, CIT593, CIT594, and CIT595), I would say this class tops them all in terms of the time commit
I have been putting in. Having to prove and solve problems you never seen before is no joke. Anyway, I have to get back to it..
