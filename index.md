# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas - but you can call me Tom. I am a software engineer and a recent graduate from the University of Pennsylvania's MCIT program. I mainly focus on front-end development and love building stuff for people. 

My technical skills include HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Python, Java, and C. I am always trying to improve my craft and learn new technologies. If you are curious, you can read what I am up to in my blog.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Head Teaching Assistant for CIT 591 - Software Development with [Prof. Brandon Krakowsky](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/brandon-krakowsky/).

When I am not coding all day, I like to play games (Escape from Tarkov, Squad, DOTA 2), ride my motorcycle, and listen to music.
