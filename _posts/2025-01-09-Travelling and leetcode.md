It is now 2025, year of the snake (woo I am snake). These past 3 months went by really quick even though I've been just interview prepping with leetcode and was abroad visiting my grandparents in Vietnam. Indeed, it has been a tough market, so hopefully things get better. In the mean time, we just have to keep pushing forward and do what we can. Signing off now to get back to the grind.
