This year has been really hectic since my last blog post in February. That time, I learned I was going to be a dad. Fast forward 9 months later and here we are, with my daughter Leah sleeping in her bassinet beside me. It has been a really tough with work and school, especially while taking CIT596 Algorithms over the summer. That was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken in my life. But, I am glad it is over and now I get to enjoy being a dad. We're almost across the finish line, just 3 more classes and I will be done with my masters.. I will try my best to pick back up on blogging.
