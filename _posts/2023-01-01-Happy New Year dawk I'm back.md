Yep, time sure went by really fast. I remember when I first started using Jekyll it was actually around this time last year. Everything seemed pretty daunting at first,
so I opted to use the [al-folo](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme that time. I remember wasting so much time trying to set up the deployment work flow for it since nothing worked smoothly out of the box. You had to mess with the GitHub pages settings and set the deployment branch to 'gh-pages' since that is what Github Pages is expecting. Eventually, I got the first deployment to work but anything after that would fail. So, I didn't really bother to blog much after that. 

Now, it is a new year 2023 and I am looking to give Jekyll another try and hopefully start writing more often. This time, I decided that I was going to create my own theme since I wanted to learn the Jekyll file structure and build it myself. I took inspiration from the al-folio theme, particularly the nav bar. My intention was to include a dark mode feature since that was the very thing I liked most about that theme. Since the al-folio theme is aimed towards scholars, it comes bundled with many dependencies like jQuery, fontAwesome, and other 3rd party libraries. 

I wanted something more lightweight and simple to maintain so that is how my theme minnie came to be. Minnie is meant to be very minimal that you could build upon it yourself. It is not meant to be full of features out of the box. There are plently of themes that come with bells and whistles, but that was not the goal here. For the most part it is done, but I am still working on polishing it and making it more modular before it's first release. I think I will write a few more blogs before I think of what I will do next.
